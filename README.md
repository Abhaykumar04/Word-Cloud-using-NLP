### Video Source:

##### The speech is available in video format via the following link: https://youtu.be/ixRanV-rdAQ.

### Python Libraries:

##### To analyze the speech, several Python libraries were utilized including:

• re: for regular expressions

• pandas: for data manipulation

• matplotlib: for data visualization

• nltk: for natural language processing

• wordcloud: for generating word clouds

### Nltk Tasks:

#### Specifically, the nltk library was used to perform tasks such as:

• Tokenization: Breaking the speech into individual words or tokens
 
• Sentence segmentation: Splitting the speech into individual sentences
 
• Lemmatization: Converting words to their base or dictionary form
 
• Stopwords Removal:
The stopwords module from the nltk library was used to remove commonly occurring words that do not carry much meaning, such as "the", "and", "of", etc. This helped in focusing on the more significant words and phrases used in the speech.

### Word Cloud Generation:

##### Additionally, a word cloud was generated using the wordcloud library to provide a visual representation of the most frequently occurring words in the speech. The size of each word in the cloud represents its frequency in the speech.

##### Overall, this project provides insight into the key themes and topics discussed by Sundar Pichai during his opening speech at Google I/O 2023. The use of various Python libraries and NLP techniques helped in understanding the speech's content and providing meaningful insights.
